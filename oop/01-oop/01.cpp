/**
What is Object Oriented Programming?

Structuring programs around the idea of objects & data, not actions.

**************************************************
OOP Example
**************************************************
Let's say you have a programmtic dog. All doggos have certain properties. We could represent this data in
array, where all the data is represented in specific indexes for each property. We could also write a bunch
of functions like doDoggoEat(), or doDoggoBark(). Or, with object oriented programming, we can represent the
dog as an object, which has specific attributes and behaviors. These attributes are saved in the form of member
data structures, and behaviors are represented as functions. 

Our dog object could have properties or attributes like "color", "weight", "cuteness", and etc. It could have
behaviors like eating, walking, and barking.

An object is our basic blueprint for all future doggos. It's reusable, and flexible. It *encapsulates* data, by
making only necessary details available to the program outside of the object. Doggo functions, also known as
methods, and allow the outside program to access the behaviors of the doggo. Data in the object is safely
stored, so that if it can be accessed, it is only through methods. Sometimes known as "getters" and "setters". 

**************************************************
OOP Workflow
**************************************************
Traditional workflow:
Write a program, with functions to sperate code blocks, and data shared either globally or by passing it through
functions. Once projects get bigger, and there starts to be more, related data, this gets unweildy, unintuitive,
and difficult to use.__a

Object Oriented Programming:
Create "Objects" to represent data. These objects have well defined behaviors in the form of methods, and related
data. Makes code re-use easier and more intuitive. Helps with breaking up a program into a number of files that
do one thing and do one thing well.
